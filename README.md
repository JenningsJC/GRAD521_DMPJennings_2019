# Data Management Plan for Research Project: Food Web Responses to Stage 0 Floodplain Restoration of South Fork of McKenzie River, OR  

## Context of Project  
The South Fork of the McKenzie River (SFMR) is a heavily-modified, deeply incised, single-channel system that provides relatively poor spawning and rearing habitat for fishes as compared to conditions before human modification of the floodplain. Stage zero restoration of this system will emulate a natural flood event where the alluvial valley floodplain is scoured and leveled, leaving behind an interconnecting system of side-channels and pools, restoring groundwater connectivity, habitat diversity and connectivity to the riparian zone. "Stage 0" refers to the hydro-geological and ecological state of the system before human modification, where ecosystem services and production was at its full potential, food webs were complex and diverse, and dynamic natural processes were intact. Stage 0 restoration of the lowest reach of the SFMR was accomplished during the summer of 2018 by diverting the river while tractors filled in the main channel with aggregates and sediments, berms and other riparian zone modifications were leveled to restore the flood plain, and hundreds of logs were placed by helicopter to create natural snags and jams. The river was then slowly returned to the mainstem and allowed to push the fill material and debris wherever it naturally flowed.
