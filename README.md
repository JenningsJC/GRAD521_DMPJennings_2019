# Data Management Plan for Research Project: Food Web Responses to Stage 0 Floodplain Restoration of South Fork of McKenzie River, OR  

## Context of Project  
The South Fork of the McKenzie River (SFMR) is a heavily-modified system, with a high headwater dam about 4 miles from its confluence with the mainstem McKenzie River. The river segment below the dam was once prime chinook, bull trout and cut throat trout habitat, but after dam construction, became a single channel system with poor connectivity to the flood plain and the segment became poor fish habitat. Stage zero restoration of this system will emulate a natural flood event where the alluvial valley floodplain is scoured and leveled, leaving behind an interconnecting system of side-channels and pools, restoring groundwater connectivity, habitat diversity and connectivity to the riparian zone. "Stage 0" refers to the hydro-geological and ecological state of the system before human modification with ecosystem services intact, complex and diverse food webs, and dynamic natural processes at play. Stage 0 restoration of the lowest reach of the SFMR was accomplished during the summer of 2018 by diverting the river while tractors filled in the main channel with aggregates and sediments, berms and other riparian zone modifications were leveled to restore the flood plain, and hundreds of logs were placed by helicopter to create natural snags and jams. The river was then slowly returned to the mainstem and allowed to push the fill material and debris wherever it naturally flowed.
