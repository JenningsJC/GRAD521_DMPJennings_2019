## Data Management Plan for Research Project: Food Web Responses to Stage 0 Floodplain Restoration of South Fork of McKenzie River, OR  

## Context of Project:  
The South Fork of the McKenzie River is a heavily-modified, deeply incised, single-channel system that provides poor spawning and rearing habitat for endangered salmonids like chinook and bull trout, as well as other native and naturalized fishes. Stage zero restoration of this system will emulate a natural flood event where the alluvial valley floodplain is scoured and leveled, leaving behind an interconnecting system of side-channels and pools, restoring groundwater connectivity, habitat diversity and connectivity to the riparian zone. "Stage 0" refers to the hydro-geological and ecological state of the system before human modification, where ecosystem services and production was at its full potential, food webs were complex and diverse, and dynamic natural processes were intact. This will be accomplished by diverting a reach of the river while tractors fill in the main channel with aggregates and sediments, berms and other riparian zone modifications are leveled to restore the flood plain, and large woody debris is placed to create natural snags and jams. The river is then slowly returned to the mainstem and allowed to push the fill material and debris wherever it naturally flows. The aquatic food web will be assessed before and after the restoration by stomach content and stable isotope analysis of focal salmonid species and a subset of other native and naturalized fishes. Focus will be on relative proportions of invertebrate taxa contributing to fish diets, as well as terrestrial production versus aquatic production contributing to the diet. These data will be collected at multiple sites in the target reach over time to capture seasonality and other production dynamics, both before restoration, immediately after restoration, and periodically for 3 years after.
