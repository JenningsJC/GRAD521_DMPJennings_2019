# Data description
The aquatic food webs in both the restored lower reach of the South Fork McKenzie River and an unrestored, upstream reference reach will be sampled at least 4 times a year beginning in the Spring of 2019. Fishes (native and naturalized/invasive) will be captured, identified, measured and weighed to determine relative abundance of species and population estimates. Stomach contents of fishes will be used to construct food webs. Stomach contents and fin clips will also be analyzed for stable isotopes in order to determine the input of allochthonous versus autochthonous production to that food web and determine placement within the meta-web structure. Dominant riparian vegetation, periphyton and detritus will be collected for mass, chlorophyll a and stable isotopes to inform the flow of production/energy through the aquatic food web.  Aquatic invertebrates will be sampled for density and relative abundance. These data will be collected from different habitat patches throughout the target reach, using stratified sampling to reflect the distribution of habitat types within the target patch (proportional to distribution of riffles, pools, side channels, etc.) in order to capture the spatial and temporal changes in the aquatic food web that may result from the stage 0 restoration actions.

Dataset Types and Method of Collection

Field Data Sheets: these will record metadata such as date, time, location, personnel, atmospheric and limnologic conditions, fish lengths and wet weights, habitat descriptors, and any other direct measures taken in the field.

Fish Specimens: non-salmonid fishes will be captured via angling, netting or electro-fishing, measured, euthanized and stored in ethanol solution in individual jars for transport to the lab for later processing.

Fish Stomach Content Specimens: Salmonids and sculpins will be live-captured and stomach contents evacuated via gastric lavage. Contents will be stored in ethanol solution and transported to the lab for processing.

Periphyton and Aquatic Primary Producer Samples: Periphyton will be scraped from rocks, algal mats and plants shaken loose from the substrate, both from a known planar area, into a bottomless bucket and water samples filtered over glass filter, frozen and stored in the dark for later analysis.

Benthic and Aquatic Invertebrates: Surber samplers will be used to collect invertebrate samples from the substrate, sieved to remove large debris, and stored in ethanol solution for transport to the lab.

Records of Analysis: multiple spreadsheets, isotopic analysis reports, statistical software analysis code, graphics, tables of results, and physical specimens will be generated after samples are dried, isotopes analyzed, and invertebrates identified.

Estimated Quantity/Size of Datasets
Several hundred benthic invertebrate specimens, several hundred fish specimens, two or three field journals, multiple laboratory journals, a hundred MB of spreadsheets in .csv format, several GB of pictures, graphs, tables, videos for publications and presentations.

# Roles and responsibilities
1.	I will write and implement my data management plan. I will be solely responsible for data collection in the field, including metadata, and data entry. Some data collection will also occur in the laboratory, in which case assistants will be responsible for data collection and I will conduct quality control checks and database entry. Grad student 1 from my laboratory will be responsible for double-checking data entry from field and laboratory journals. I will be responsible for data organization in terms of methods used for storage, datasheets, database format, etc.. All data generated will ultimately go to the PI, who will also conduct quality control. Both myself and the PI will be responsible for archiving and preserving data; these data are instrumental to the PIâ€™s larger project and will be joined with other data and archived separately, while I will archive my data with the US Forest Service Research Data Archive, the Fish Passage Center, and the Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership.
2.	Sensitive data consist of information that if made public, could expose individuals to harm through identity theft, embarrassment, or other means, as well as information that could endanger the national interest if made public, such as defense vulnerabilities or superior technologies. My data will consist of the stomach contents of fish and the carbon and nitrogen isotopes of those contents, none of which is sensitive.
3.	The US Forest Service will be funding my project, and will be paying me a monthly stipend. I will have the responsibility to record and secure the data according to Forest Service protocols, and will have the right to keep, use and publish the data, but this is secondary to the needs of the multi-agency, multi-objective adaptive management project that the PI is leading. There may be additional data sharing or access requirements or agreements that I am not aware of at this time, as there are multiple federal and state agencies, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, native tribes, two universities, and a local watershed council also involved. I have a long conference call coming next week where my advisor, the PI, and another researcher will begin to sort all of this out.
