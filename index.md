# Data Description

The aquatic food webs in both the restored lower reach of the South Fork McKenzie River and an unrestored, upstream reference reach will be sampled at least 4 times a year beginning in the Spring of 2019. Fishes (native and naturalized/invasive) will be captured, identified, measured and weighed to determine relative abundance of species and population estimates. Stomach contents of fishes will be used to construct food webs. Stomach contents and fin clips will also be analyzed for stable isotopes in order to determine the input of allochthonous versus autochthonous production to that food web and determine placement within the meta-web structure. Dominant riparian vegetation, periphyton and detritus will be collected for mass, chlorophyll a and stable isotopes to inform the flow of production/energy through the aquatic food web.  Aquatic invertebrates will be sampled for density and relative abundance. These data will be collected from different habitat patches throughout the target reach, using stratified sampling to reflect the distribution of habitat types within the target patch (proportional to distribution of riffles, pools, side channels, etc.) in order to capture the spatial and temporal changes in the aquatic food web that may result from the stage 0 restoration actions.

**Dataset Types and Method of Collection**

*Field Data Sheets:* these will record metadata such as date, time, location, personnel, atmospheric and limnologic conditions, fish lengths and wet weights, habitat descriptors, and any other direct measures taken in the field.

*Fish Specimens:* non-salmonid fishes will be captured via angling, netting or electro-fishing, measured, euthanized and stored in ethanol solution in individual jars for transport to the lab for later processing.

*Fish Stomach Content Specimens:* Salmonids and sculpins will be live-captured and stomach contents evacuated via gastric lavage. Contents will be stored in ethanol solution and transported to the lab for processing.

*Periphyton and Aquatic Primary Producer Samples:* Periphyton will be scraped from rocks, algal mats and plants shaken loose from the substrate, both from a known planar area, into a bottomless bucket and water samples filtered over glass filters, frozen and stored in the dark for later analysis.

*Benthic and Aquatic Invertebrates:* Surber samplers will be used to collect invertebrate samples from the substrate, sieved to remove large debris, and stored in ethanol solution for transport to the lab.

*Records of Analysis:* multiple spreadsheets, isotopic analysis reports, statistical software analysis code, graphics, tables of results, and physical specimens will be generated after samples are dried, isotopes analyzed, and invertebrates identified.

**Estimated Quantity/Size of Datasets:**
Several hundred benthic invertebrate specimens, several hundred fish specimens, two or three field journals, multiple laboratory journals, a hundred MB of spreadsheets in .csv format, several GB of pictures, graphs, tables, videos for publications and presentations.

# Roles and Responsibilities

**1.**	I will  submit my data management plan to my major professor and the US Forest Service PI for review, revise accordingly, and implement it. I will be responsible for sample collection and data entry in the field, including metadata. I will be responsible for training field sampling assistants to follow data entry protocols and inspect data sheets and sample containers for completeness and accuracy. Some data collection will also occur in the laboratory, where I will be responsible for establishing data entry and sample sorting protocols, and training assistants to maintain those protocols. I will be responsible for entering data from data sheets into spreadsheets for summary statistical analyses and conversion into .csv files for import into statistical software tools. I will be responsible for data organization in terms of methods used for storage, datasheets, database format, field books, etc.. All data generated will ultimately go to the US Forest Service PI, who will conduct quality control. Both myself and the PI will be responsible for archiving and preserving data; these data are instrumental to the PIâ€™s larger project and will be joined with other data and archived separately, while I will archive my data with the US Forest Service Research Data Archive, the Fish Passage Center, the Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership, and Oregon State University's institutional data repository, ScholarsArchive@OSU.

**2.**	Sensitive data consist of information that if made public, could expose individuals to harm through identity theft, embarrassment, or other means, as well as information that could endanger the national interest if made public, such as defense vulnerabilities or superior technologies. My data will consist of non-sensitive data such as the stomach contents of fish and the carbon and nitrogen isotopes of those contents.

**3.**	The US Forest Service is funding my project and employing me as a research assistant. I am ultimately obligated to record and secure the data as directed by the US Forest Service PI who will mentor me. I am expected to keep and use and the data I collect to author an article for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The data I collect will be critical to a long-term BACI study examining effects during and after the restoration. There may be additional data sharing or access requirements with collaborators on the BACI study that the Forest Service has not shared with me at this time. There are multiple federal and state agencies, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, native tribes, two universities, and a local watershed council involved in this restoration, and I have not met with all of them yet. Details will be updated after the research proposal is drafted and approved by my PI and graduate committee.
